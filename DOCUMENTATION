Discovery:

While I am pretty familiar with the Objective-C / Cocoa-Touch api, Cocoa is somewhat different.  For one, I do not have use of any of the UI-classes, and am limited to the NS-based methods.
I hope that classes such as NSView are similar enough to UIView that I will not have too much difficulty with the implementation.  

Analysis:
I plan to build using a split view

Architecture:


Synthesis:

Documentation of Process:

I had intended on using an Outline view for the left hand navigation, but building out the item hierarchy is proving to be difficult.  I may have to go with something simpler, such as a NSTableView or in the interest of time I may just use a series of buttons.  

I had to restart the project because I didn't understand the way nibs are wired into the app delegate.  It seems that the delegate really wants there to be a main window and menu.  My efforts to remove them uncoupled something important.  I'm now going to pass a reference to the window to my custom window controller, so that my event handling is outside the app delegate.
