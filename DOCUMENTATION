Discovery:

While I am pretty familiar with the Objective-C / Cocoa-Touch api, Cocoa is somewhat different.  For one, I do not have use of any of the UI-classes, and am limited to the NS-based methods.
I hope that classes such as NSView are similar enough to UIView that I will not have too much difficulty with the implementation.  

Analysis:
I plan to build using a split view

Architecture:


Synthesis:

Documentation of Process:

I had intended on using an Outline view for the left hand navigation, but building out the item hierarchy is proving to be difficult.  I may have to go with something simpler, such as a NSTableView or in the interest of time I may just use a series of buttons.  

I had to restart the project because I didn't understand the way nibs are wired into the app delegate.  It seems that the delegate really wants there to be a main window and menu. 
My efforts to remove them uncoupled something important.  I'm now going to pass a reference to the window to my custom window controller, so that my event handling is outside the app delegate. 

I finally rigged the buttons to work with the right callback to the window controller.  I'm going to set up a new view to deal with the widgets that live under each category.  

todo:  still have to figure out how the NSPathControl works.  I know how to deal with an NSSlider.  NSLevelIndicator is a bit of a mistery to me.  
Actually, I"m putting the NSPathControl object in the ListView nib.  

need to set a delegate for the NSTextField in the controller for that view.  

popup view needs to be wired into some kind of popup action

i will need to figure out how tables work, since that is one of the sections.  The tree view has that list model that was giving me trouble.  I'll have to work out a better way to build that.
